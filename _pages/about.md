I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas with a passion for data analysis. I have one year of experience in interpreting, analyzing and visualizing data. Developing visually appealing, user-friendly charts, diagrams, and graphs to present conclusions from the analysis is my way of working.

I’m seeking opportunities to work in the field of data analysis to hone my analytical & statistical skills.

I’m always interested in hearing from colleagues, managers, or just creative folks who share the same passion, so feel free to contact me.
